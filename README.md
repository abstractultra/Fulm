# Fulm

In Esperanto, 'fulm' is the root word for 'lightning'. Time-lapse video in Esperanto is 'fulmfilmeto', literally translating to 'lightning video.'

Just like how Esperanto serves as the universal language, Fulm presents itself as a universal solution for a time-lapse screen recorder. Instead of recording hours-long footage only to be condensed into a few minutes, Fulm saves you the pain and time by simply taking screenshots every so often which then become combined into a time-lapse video.

I take on extreme learning challenges, such as studying C++ for 10 hours a day over the Winter Break. I often record my journeys to keep myself accountable, but I'm not too estatic about storing and processing 10-hour-long footages on my 7-year-old laptop. I tried searching for a time-lapse screen recorder, but many were limited to Windows. I did find one that supported MacOS, but it would sometimes delete my screenshots and lacked many crucial features. After emailing the developer about my concerns and receiving no response (after paying $25 for it, too!), I decided that I would take matters into my own hands and develop an app that all users can benefit from.
