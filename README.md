# Fulm

In Esperanto, 'fulm' is the root word for 'lightning'. Time-lapse video in Esperanto is 'fulmfilmeto', literally translating to 'lightning video.'

Just like how Esperanto serves as the universal language, Fulm presents itself as a universal solution for a time-lapse screen recorder. Instead of recording hours-long footage only to be condensed into a few minutes, Fulm saves you the pain and time by simply taking screenshots every *x* seconds (you decide) which then become combined into a time-lapse video.
